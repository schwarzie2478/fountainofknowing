Developed by the [authors of Accelerate](https://microservices.io/post/microservices/2020/01/07/books-about-high-performance-software-delivery.html), the DORA metrics measure the performance of a software development teams:

- [[Concepts/Deployment frequency\|Deployment frequency]] - the frequency with which software changes are deployed to production.
- [[Concepts/Lead time for changes\|Lead time for changes]] - the time it takes to go from commit to deploy.
- Time to restore service - the time it takes to restore service after a production incident or outage.
- [[Concepts/Change failure rate\|Change failure rate]] - the percentage of production deployments that result in a failure or require remediation.

- [ ] The [DORA DevOps Quick Check](https://dora.dev/quickcheck/) is a simple five question assessment of how well you are delivering software.
