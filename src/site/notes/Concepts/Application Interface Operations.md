Additional definition: APIOps creates a standardized process and collaborative culture to accelerate how your organization creates APIs and maintains them throughout their life cycle.

APIOps applies the concepts of [[Concepts/GitOps\|GitOps]] and [[Concepts/DevOps\|DevOps]] to API deployment.

Â APIOps is a relatively new term that describes an approach to building APIs that combines:

- The automation, collaboration, quick iteration and focus on quality from a thriving DevOps culture.
- The single source of truth and emphasis on CI/CD pipelines from GitOps.
