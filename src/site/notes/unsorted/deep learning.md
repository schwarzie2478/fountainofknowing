Deep learning is a type of [[unsorted/machine learning\|machine learning]] that uses [[unsorted/neural networks\|neural networks]].

Using deep learning, the neural networks can make decisions based on [[unsorted/unstructured data\|unstructured data]] and/ or [[unsorted/unlabeled data\|unlabeled data]]

neural networks consist of interconnected units that collaborate to learn from data and produce informed predictions to solve complex problems

> [!NOTE]
> neural networks are structured so that they can continue to learn and make predictions without directions
